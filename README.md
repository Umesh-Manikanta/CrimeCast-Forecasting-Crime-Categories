# üéì CrimeCast: Forecasting Crime Categories

This project is part of the **Machine Learning** course in the **IITM B.Sc Data Science** program. The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of forecasting different categories of crimes using historical crime data. The insights generated by the model can assist in crime prevention strategies and resource allocation.

## üè¢ Introduction
The **CrimeCast** project leverages machine learning techniques to accurately predict crime categories. By analyzing historical crime data, we build predictive models to provide insights into crime types, helping authorities allocate resources more effectively.

## üìä Data
- **Dataset**:
  - **Train Set**: Contains features and labels for training the model.
  - **Test Set**: Contains only features for prediction purposes.
- **Features**:
  - Time details (date and time of occurrence)
  - Place details (location, latitude, longitude)
  - Crime details
  - Victim demographics
  - Suspect's modus operandi

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values, cleaning, and feature engineering.
   - Feature selection by excluding non-essential columns.
   - Splitting date and time features into components like year, month, day, and weekend information.

2. **Model Selection**:
   - Tested multiple classifiers, including:
     - `RandomForestClassifier`
     - `GradientBoostingClassifier`
     - `MLPClassifier` (performed the best)

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Used **RandomizedSearchCV** to optimize hyperparameters and improve model performance.

4. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Expanded Modus Operandi into individual binary features.
   - Applied feature scaling and encoding to categorical data.

5. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Final model trained using **MLPClassifier**, achieving an accuracy of **95.9%**.

## üìà Results
- **MLPClassifier** achieved the highest performance with an accuracy of **95.9%**.
- The model showed strong predictive power in identifying crime categories based on various features.
- Created visualizations to illustrate the distribution of crimes by time, location, victim age, and other factors.
